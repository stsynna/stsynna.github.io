# Hello!

My name is [St Synna](https://github.com/stsynna), but you can call me **Syn**. I like learning, and currently I'm learning to code to build things (simple apps and games for now).

I stream on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/st_synna) for fun - usually indie games, Genshin, and other things I'm interested in like Art and learning Japanese. I post my VODs and my videos on practicing my Japanese on [Youtube](http://youtube.com/@st_synna).

My current projects are available here: [tiny.cc/synstuff](http://tiny.cc/synstuff).
